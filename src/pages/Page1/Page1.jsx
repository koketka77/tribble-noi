What do North Carolina’s red wolves, the Eurasian beaver and Przewalski’s horse have in common?

All of them went extinct in the wild – and all of them came back, thanks to reintroduction programs.

Conservation scientists use translocation and captive breeding to re-establish animal populations that have died out in the wild – either entirely or in certain areas. Reintroducing extinct-in-the-wild animals to their native territories can be a double win: helping to restore degraded ecosystems, as well as increasing population numbers.


But setting a species loose in the wild is a precarious balancing act. Reintroductions often take years and involve multiple phases, says Natasha Robinson, an ecologist at the Australian National University who specializes in threatened wildlife.</p></div>
